Welcome to QuizApp's documentation!
===================================

QuizApp is a platform for conducting experiments in the form of online surveys.
It is highly generalized, which makes it useful for a wide variety of
experiments.

At the fundamental level, QuizApp allows you to show a participant a sequence
of assignments. These assignments can be anything from instructional screens to
questions to reviews of the participant's past performance. The participant's
responses to these assignments are stored in the database and associated with
the assignment set that they completed. An experiment contains several
assignment sets.

This structure allows researchers to have fine grain control over what each
participant sees as well as detailed information about how each participant
responded to each assignment.

For more information, please read through the documentation listed below.
